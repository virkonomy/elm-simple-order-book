# Order Book Form in Elm

This is a simple implementation or order book form, typically founded in crypto exchange. Elm provide a simple structure, complete ecosystem, high maintainability, fast and robust result. Unlike my other javascript project which makes me cringe everytime I need to add new feature, same challange will usually put grin in your face when dealing with Elm codebase.

The best thing is: You will spend zero time debugging runtime error and focus on its functionality.
